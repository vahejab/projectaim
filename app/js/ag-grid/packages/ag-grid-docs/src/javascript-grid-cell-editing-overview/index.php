    <h1>Cell Editing Overview</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        Cell Renderer's are for displaying data and Cell Editors are for editing data.
        If your application is for showing data only, such as a reporting application, then you will not
        need to use cell editors. If you are editing your data like a spreadsheet, then you will
        need Cell Editors to do the editing.
