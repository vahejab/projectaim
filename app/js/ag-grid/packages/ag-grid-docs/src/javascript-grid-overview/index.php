    <h1>Documentation Overview</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        ag-Grid is not just about the JavaScript code we write, it is about the documentation as well.
        We believe documentation and examples are vital to assisting the developer on their
        journey of learning ag-Grid.
    </p>

    <p>
        We take as much pride in our documentation as we do in the ag-Grid library itself.
        We are developers, these documentation pages are written for you, developers talking
        to developers.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to Start</h2>

    <p>
        Start with the <a href="../javascript-grid-getting-started/">Getting Started</a> section
        relevant to your framework. Learn how to set up a simple instance of ag-Grid and learn
        the difference between ag-Grid Community and ag-Grid Enterprise.
    </p>

    <p>
        We invite all JavaScript developers to use ag-Grid Community for free and then those
        who want to go the extra mile to become our customers of ag-Grid Enterprise.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to go Next</h2>

    <p>
        Once you have the basics of creating a simple grid, then jump to the features you are interested
        in. Then bookmark <a href="../javascript-grid-reference-overview/">Interface / API</a>, you will
        constantly refer to this section for looking up those property and event names.
