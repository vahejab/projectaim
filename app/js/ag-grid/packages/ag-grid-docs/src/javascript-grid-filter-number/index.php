<h1>Number Filter</h1>

    Number filters allow you to filter number data.

<p>
    Unlike <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-text/">Text</a> and <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-date/">Date</a>
    filters, the Number filter does not have any features beyond those shared with the other simple filters and
    already explained in <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-provided/">Provided Filters</a> and
    <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-provided-simple/">Provided Simple Filters</a>.
