    <h1>Third Party Charting</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        This section goes through examples of integrating the grid with <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>
        (for charting outside of the grid) and
        <a href="https://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/">Sparklines</a> (for charting inside the grid).
    </p>

    <note>
        In v21 of ag-Grid we introduced charting using the grid's own
        <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-overview/">internal charting library</a>. This page pre-dates the grids
        internal charting library. It is our plan in the future to allow using the charting library
        to achieve the below, but for now we will leave the examples using D3 and Sparklines.
    </note>

    <h2>External Graphs using D3</h2>

    <p>D3 is a powerful Graphing Library. In this example we provide an example that displays a simple ag-Grid table of stock
    data that when clicked on provides a simple time-series chart of the corresponding data. Multiple rows (or stocks) can be
    selected to provide a comparison between stocks.</p>

<?= example('External Graphs using D3', 'stocks-master-detail', 'vanilla', array("enterprise" => 1, "exampleHeight" => 820)) ?>

    <h2>Inline Graphs using jQuery Sparklines</h2>

    <p>jQuery Sparklines is a great library that offers small but rich graphs - ideal for use within ag-Grid.</p>

    <p>In this example we demonstrate the following:</p>

    <ul class="content">
        <li>Close Trend: Inline summary trend graph. If clicked on the full time-series
        will be displayed below.</li>
        <li>Average Volume: The average volume per year in a Bar Graph.</li>
        <li>Target Expenditure: Illustrates how a graph can be used withing a cell editor. If double clicked (or enter
            pressed) a popup editor in the form of a Pie Chart will be shown - when a segment is clicked on the value
            will be saved down to the grid.</li>
        <li>Expenditure: Expenditure shown in a Pie Chart.</li>
    </ul>

    <?= example('Inline Graphs', 'inline-graphs', 'vanilla', array("enterprise" => 1, "exampleHeight" => 850, "extras" => array("lodash", "d3", "jquery", "sparkline"))) ?>
