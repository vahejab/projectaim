    <h1 class="heading-enterprise">Charts - BETA</h1>

    <p class="lead">
       This section introduces the grid's integrated charting functionality that allows users to chart directly inside
        the grid and supports applications that want to create pre-defined charts.
    </p>

    <p>
        The charting functionality is deeply integrated with the grid. This integration gives users
        a seamless charting experience while keeping the coding required by developers to a minimum.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are not aware of any other datagrid that provides such integration. Other companies may provide
        a grid library and / or a charting library, but it's up to the developer to tie the two together.
    </p>

    <p>
        This section introduces the two ways charts can be created from the data contained in the grid:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-overview/#user-created-charts">User Created Charts</a>: A user creates a
            chart using the grid's UI by selecting a range of cells and then selecting to chart via the context menu.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-overview/#application-created-charts">Application Created Charts</a>:
            The application requests the grid to create a chart through the grid's charting API.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <note>
        We are very excited to be introducing ag-Grid's new charting capability, however please be advised that there
        could be some breaking changes around the API while it is still in beta. Please give us your feedback via
        <a href="https://ag-grid.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>, for existing customers, alternatively
        <a href="https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/">Github</a> can also be used.
        </br>
    </note>

    <h2>Charts Module</h2>

    <p>
        To minimise bundle sizes for applications that do not require charting, charts are contained in a separate
        module, which can be imported as follows:
    </p>

    <snippet>
        import 'ag-grid-enterprise';
        import 'ag-grid-enterprise/chartsModule';
    </snippet>

    <p>
        The charts module has been built from the ground up with zero dependencies on any third party libraries.
    </p>

    <note>
        If you are not using ES6 Modules and instead using the bundled version of ag-Grid Enterprise, note that
        <code>ag-grid-enterprise.js</code> already contains the charting module.
    </note>

    <h2>Enabling Charts</h2>
    <p>
        To enable charting in the grid set the following grid option:
    </p>

<snippet>
gridOptions = {
    enableCharts: true
}
</snippet>

    <p>
        To allow users to create charts from a
        <a href="../javascript-grid-range-selection/">Range Selection</a> and / or display the
        <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-chart-ranges/">Chart Ranges</a> in the grid, then set the following grid
        option:
    </p>

<snippet>
gridOptions = {
    enableRangeSelection: true
}
</snippet>

    <h2>User Created Charts</h2>
    <p>
        User created charts are designed to provide an out-of-the box charting experience, similar to that found in
        spreadsheet applications such as Excel, but more compelling it will be integrated inside your applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        All that is required for users to create charts, from the data already contained in the grid,
        is to import the <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-overview/#charts-module">charts module</a>
        and <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-overview/#enabling-charts">enable charts</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Try it out on our <a href="../example.php">demo page</a> by doing the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Select a <a href="../javascript-grid-range-selection/">Cell Range</a> of numeric values in the grid by dragging
            the mouse over a range of cells.
        </li>
        <li>
            The bring up the <a href="../javascript-grid-context-menu">Context Menu</a> and select the desired chart type
            from the 'Chart Range' sub menu.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <div style="flex-grow: 1;">
            <ul>
                <p>
                <li><a href="../javascript-grid-charts-chart-ranges/">Chart Ranges</a>: When a chart is created, corresponding
                    chart ranges appear in the grid and are adjusted via the chart range handle.
                </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                <li><a href="../javascript-grid-charts-chart-ranges/#category-and-series-ranges/">Categories and Series</a>:
                    Columns can be configured as either categories or series for charting. If not configured then the
                    grid will infer whether a column is category or series data.
                </li>
                </p>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <img src="./category-range-fill-handle.png"/>

    </div>

    <div style="display: flex; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 25px; margin-left: 40px;">

        <img src="./chart-toolbar.png"/>

        <div style="flex-grow: 1;">
            <ul>
                <p>
                    <li><a href="../javascript-grid-charts-chart-toolbar/">Chart Toolbar</a>:
                    The chart toolbar is located in the top right area of the chart and brings
                    the user to UI components to perform the following:
                </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Change the chart type</li>
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Change the colour palette</li>
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Select categories and series columns</li>
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px">Format the chart</li>
                        <li>Download the chart</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    </div>

    <p>
        By default, user created charts are displayed inside the grid's own popup windows. The windows can be moved (by mouse
        dragging the windows title bar) and resized (by mouse dragging the windows borders).
    </p>

    <p>
        It is also possible to display user created charts in an another location or application dialog. For more details
        see the section on <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-customisation/#providing-a-chart-container/">providing a chart container</a>.
    </p>

    <note>
        If using the grid's own popup window, you will probably want to use the grid option
        <code>popupParent</code> so that the popup windows are not constrained to the bounds of the grid.
        Typically users set <code>popupParent=document.body</code> to achieve this.
    </note>

    <h2>Application Created Charts</h2>

    <p>
        Charts can be pre-defined or dynamically created from within applications, and as with
        <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-overview/#user-created-charts">user created charts</a>, these charts also
        benefit from the integration provided with the grid.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dummy financial application below just touches on what is possible with the grid's integrated
        charting capabilities. The following should be noted:
    </p>

    <ul class="content">
        <li>
            <b>Pre-Defined Chart</b>: A pre-defined chart is shown in a separate chart container below the grid.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Dynamic Charts</b>: Buttons positioned above the grid dynamically create different chart types.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>High Performance</b>: 100 rows are randomly updated 10 times a second (1,000 updates per second).
            Try updating the example via plunker with higher update frequencies and more data.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <?= example('Application Created Charts', 'application-created-charts', 'vanilla', array( "exampleHeight" => 660, 'enterprise' => true)) ?>

    <p>
        To learn how to create charts in your applications see the following sections for details:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="../javascript-grid-charts-chart-range-api/">Chart Range API</a>: Used to create charts programmatically
            inside applications.
        </li>
        <li><a href="../javascript-grid-charts-customisation/#providing-a-chart-container/">Provide a Chart Container</a>:
            Used to target chart containers inside the application instead of the popup window provided by the grid.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chart Customisation</h2>

    <p>
        Before each chart is created, the developer can do fine grained
        <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-customisation/">Chart Customisation</a> to change the charts
        appearance and behaviour. For example you can change the thickness of the lines, or customise the
        formatting of the axis labels.
    </p>

    <p>
        The section <a href="../javascript-grid-charts-customisation/">Chart Customisation</a> outlines all
        the items that can be customised for each chart type.
