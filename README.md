ProjectAIM is a comprehensive tool set (Action Item Management, Issue Management, Risk Management, and Opportunity Management, and Knowledge Management)  designed to serve organizations and teams for tracking multiple aspects to a project.

Currently under development, it is written in AngularJS (Front-End) / PHP/MySQL (Back-End) and is developed as a single page application that will be migrated to a mobile device.
